# 🔐 CIA Triad – The Foundation of Cybersecurity

The **CIA Triad** is the cornerstone of cybersecurity. It guides how organizations protect their data, systems, and users by focusing on three core principles:

---

##  1. Confidentiality
> *“Only the right people can see it.”*

Ensures sensitive information is accessible **only to authorized users**. It prevents unauthorized access, data leaks, and exposure.

###  Examples:
- Password protection
- Data encryption (e.g., HTTPS, VPN)
- Access controls (role-based or need-to-know)

---

##  2. Integrity
> *“The information is accurate and hasn’t been tampered with.”*

Ensures that data is **trustworthy, unaltered**, and consistent. Unauthorized or accidental changes should be detectable.

### 🛠 Examples:
- Checksums & hash functions (e.g., SHA-256)
- File integrity monitoring
- Version control systems (e.g., Git)

---

##  3. Availability
> *“It’s there when you need it.”*

Ensures data and systems are accessible **whenever authorized users need them**. Protection from downtime, disruptions, and denial-of-service attacks.

### ⚙ Examples:
- Backups and disaster recovery plans
- Redundant systems
- DDoS protection and load balancing

##  Why It Matters

| Principle       | What Happens if It Fails?                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality | Sensitive data leaks or breaches occur   |
| Integrity       | Decisions made on inaccurate data        |
| Availability    | Systems are down when users need them    |

##  Real-World Scenario

> A hospital's system is hit by ransomware and becomes inaccessible.

- **Confidentiality**: Patient data might be exposed
- **Integrity**: Medical records could be modified or corrupted
- **Availability**: Doctors can’t access patient files in an emergency
